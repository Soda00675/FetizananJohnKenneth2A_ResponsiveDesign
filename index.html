      <h1>Life Lesson One Piece Has to Offer</h1>
      <p>One Piece is not just anime but also a source of inspiration and learning.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="lesson-col">
          <h3>Follow your dreams</h3>
          <p>
            One of the primary themes of One Piece is following your dreams. 
            The main character, Monkey D. Luffy, sets out to become the Pirate 
            King, and he never gives up on his dream, no matter what obstacles
             he faces. This is an important lesson for everyone to follow their
             dreams, even if it seems impossible or difficult.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-col">
          <h3>The importance of friendship</h3>
          <p>
            Another lesson in One Piece is the importance of friendship. 
            Luffy's crew is made up of people from all different backgrounds,
             and they all work together to achieve their goals. The crew 
             supports each other through thick and thin, and they are willing 
             to risk their lives for one another. This is a powerful message 
             about the value of true friendship.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="lesson-col">
          <h3>The consequences of power</h3>
          <p>
            One Piece also explores the consequences of power. The series 
            shows how those in positions of power can become corrupted 
            by it, and how it can be used to oppress others. This is an 
            important lesson about the responsibility that comes with 
            power and the importance of using it wisely.

      <h1>The Three Great Powers</h1>
      <p>
        The three great powers were established to maintain a balance of power. 
        Those three are the world government, the shichibukai, and the yonkou. 
        Any changes to either of these powers can cause a huge change in the 
        balance among them.

          <h3>World Government</h3>
          <p>
            The World Government is the main antagonistic faction of the One
             Piece franchise. They are a vastly powerful military and 
             political organization that rules over the entire world 
             (excluding areas controlled mainly by pirates) and seek to
              maintain their continued existence through any means necessary.

          <h3>7 Warlord of the Sea</h3>
          <p>
            The Seven Warlords of the Sea were seven extremely 
            powerful pirates who entered into the service of the 
            World Government. The purpose of the Seven Warlords 
            was to have the pirates deal with other pirates. 
            They were also a great symbol of the government's 
            strength.

          <h3>4 Emperors</h3>
          <p>
            The Yonko, also known as the Four Emperors of the Sea, 
            are the four most powerful pirates in the One Piece world.
             They rule over the second half of the Grand Line, known 
             as the New World, like Kings. They face
